Some time ago there was a task for the new job, task make my own implementation the Game of Life. And I have done it.
Hotkeys:
<ul>
<li>Space = Play/Pause</li>
<li> - = Decrease speed</li>
<li> + = Increase speed</li>
</ul>

<button onclick="pauseStop()">pause/stop</button>
<canvas id="game-canvas" width="960" height="760"></canvas>
<script src="/js/gameoflife.js"></script>
