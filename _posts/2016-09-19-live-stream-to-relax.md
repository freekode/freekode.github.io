title: Live Stream To Relax
---

I have found an interesting youtube live stream, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0euSoQ4Ue8)!

It's 24/7 stream about three kittens and thier mom. If you tired from many video compolation about kittens,
and want just to observe their full life, it's best solution.

I don't have a pet (and I can't take it), so for me such streams the best video to relax.
If nothing happening, there is 4 hour backup, full information you can reed in the description.
